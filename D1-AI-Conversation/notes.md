# Day 1 Recap: What is Generative AI & Prompt Engineering?

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to AI systems that can **create** content like text, images, music, or code — not just analyze things.  
Examples:

- ChatGPT → generates text and answers
- DALL·E → creates images
- Suno → composes music

## What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is the instruction you give an AI.  
It could be a question, a task, or even an idea.

## Prompt Engineering Basics:

Prompt engineering means writing better instructions to get better responses from AI.  
Types of prompts:

- **Zero-shot** → "Write a short story about a superhero in space."
- **Few-shot** → Give 2–3 examples first, then ask the AI to follow the same pattern.
- **Chain-of-thought** → Guide the AI step by step: “First explain the concept, then give an example, then summarize it.”

## Why It Matters:

Good prompts = Smarter, more creative AI responses.  
Learning to talk to AI clearly is a **superpower** for the future!
